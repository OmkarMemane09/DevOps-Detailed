1. Tell me about your roles and responsibilities (DevOps)

Strong answer:

In my DevOps role, I was responsible for automating infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and ensuring reliable application delivery. I worked on provisioning AWS infrastructure using Terraform, managing Kubernetes workloads, setting up monitoring and logging, and handling deployments with minimal downtime. I also collaborated with developers to containerize applications, troubleshoot production issues, and improve system reliability and security.

What interviewers actually listen for:

Automation (Terraform, CI/CD)

Cloud + Kubernetes

Ownership during failures

❌ Weak answer: “I worked on AWS, Docker, Kubernetes”
That tells them nothing.

2. How can you tell a subnet is public or private?

Exact answer:
A subnet is public if:

Its route table has a route 0.0.0.0/0 → Internet Gateway (IGW)

A subnet is private if:

It does NOT route traffic directly to IGW

Usually routes 0.0.0.0/0 → NAT Gateway

How to check practically:

AWS Console → VPC → Subnets → Route Table


❗ Public/private is NOT decided by subnet name.
If you say that, you fail.

3. What is Load Balancer in AWS & differences?

Load Balancer: Distributes traffic across multiple targets for availability and scalability.

Types:

ALB (Application LB)

Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)

Path & host-based routing

Used with microservices, Kubernetes (Ingress)

NLB (Network LB)

Layer 4 (TCP/UDP)

Ultra-low latency, static IP

Used for high-performance workloads

CLB (Classic)

Legacy, avoid unless forced

Interview tip:
If you say “ALB is for web apps, NLB for performance”, you’re safe.

4. AWS keys/passwords leaked — what action would you take?

Correct incident response order:

Immediately deactivate the compromised keys

Rotate keys and passwords

Check CloudTrail for suspicious activity

Identify blast radius (EC2, S3, IAM changes)

Apply least-privilege IAM policies

Enable MFA

Post-incident review

❌ Saying “I will change password” only = amateur.

5. NAT Gateway vs Internet Gateway
Feature	IGW	NAT GW
Internet access	Inbound + Outbound	Outbound only
Used by	Public subnet	Private subnet
Security	Exposed	Safer
Needs public IP	Yes	Yes (for NAT itself)
6. Why NAT Gateway is in a public subnet?

Because:

NAT Gateway needs internet access

It must talk to IGW

Private subnets route traffic to NAT, not internet directly

If NAT were in private subnet → no internet → useless.

7. git pull vs git fetch

git fetch → Downloads changes without merging

git pull → git fetch + git merge

Professional workflow:

git fetch origin
git diff origin/main
git merge origin/main


❌ Blind git pull in production branches = red flag.

8. Use of git cherry-pick

Used to apply a specific commit from one branch to another.

Example:

git cherry-pick <commit-id>


Use case:

Hotfix from dev → prod

Avoid merging entire branch

❗ Overuse = messy history.

9. Kubernetes commands you have used

Group them like this (interviewers love structure):

Basic:

kubectl get pods/nodes/svc
kubectl describe pod <name>
kubectl logs <pod>


Deployment:

kubectl apply -f file.yaml
kubectl delete -f file.yaml
kubectl rollout status deployment/app
kubectl rollout undo deployment/app


Debugging:

kubectl exec -it pod -- bash
kubectl get events

10. Why pods fail to start on a node?

Common reasons:

Insufficient CPU/memory

ImagePullBackOff

Node not ready

Taints & tolerations

CNI/network issue

Volume mount failure

Debug flow:

kubectl describe pod
kubectl describe node
kubectl get events

11. How do you troubleshoot ImagePullBackOff?

Steps:

kubectl describe pod

Check image name & tag

Check registry access

Verify imagePullSecrets

Test pulling image manually on node

12. Causes of ImagePullBackOff

Wrong image name/tag

Private registry auth missing

Registry down

Network/DNS issue

Rate limits (Docker Hub)

13. StatefulSet vs Deployment vs DaemonSet
Feature	Deployment	StatefulSet	DaemonSet
Identity	No	Yes	No
Use case	Stateless apps	Databases	Node agents
Volumes	Shared	Stable per pod	Optional
Scaling	Easy	Ordered	Per node
14. Do Deployments use volumes? Which volumes used?

Yes.

Common volumes:

emptyDir

configMap

secret

persistentVolumeClaim

Real-world:
Deployment + PVC for apps that need storage.

15. How is HPA set up & which component manages metrics?

Setup:

HPA uses CPU/memory/custom metrics

Requires Metrics Server

Flow:

Metrics Server → kube-apiserver → HPA → Deployment


Logs are NOT used by HPA.
If you say logs, you’re wrong.

16. Provisioner vs Provider (Terraform)

Provider → Talks to APIs (AWS, Azure)

Provisioner → Executes scripts (local-exec, remote-exec)

❗ Provisioners are last resort, not best practice.

17. How to remove Terraform drift?

Steps:

terraform plan

Identify drift

Either:

Update code

Or terraform apply to re-align

Best practice:

Avoid manual changes in cloud

Lock down permissions

18. What if Terraform state file is deleted?

Terraform loses tracking

Resources still exist

You risk duplicate creation or deletion

Recovery:

terraform import


Worst case: rebuild infra manually.

19. How did you manage Terraform state reliability?

Correct answer:

Remote backend (S3)

Versioning enabled

State locking via DynamoDB

Restricted access

❌ Local state file = junior mistake.

20. How team handles modules & how many used?

Good answer:

We used Terraform modules for reusable components like VPC, EC2, ALB, EKS, and IAM. Each module was versioned and stored in a central repository. In our project, we used around 5–8 modules to maintain consistency and reduce duplication.

Interviewers care about:

Reusability

Versioning

Clean structure
