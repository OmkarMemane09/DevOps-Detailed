1. How does DNS resolution work inside a pod?
→ And what do you check when a service isn’t reachable by name?

2. Walk me through what the controller manager does during a Deployment.
→ No rollout status. Reconciliation logic.

3. What happens if a node with local storage gets autoscaled down?
→ Be careful. This one causes data loss in prod more often than you’d think.

4. Post-deploy, latency spikes for 30% of users. No errors. No logs. What now?
→ Your answer reveals if you know how to triage chaos.

5. How do you enforce runtime security in Kubernetes?
→ PSP? AppArmor? OPA? Most people just hope for the best.

6. HPA vs VPA vs Karpenter; when would you NOT use each?
→ Bonus: How would you simulate HPA behavior in staging?

7. Tell me about the last outage you debugged in Kubernetes.
→ No postmortem? You weren’t there.
